# Water & Soil Monitoring Pro Dashboard

> Real-time water & soil sensor simulation, crop prediction, interactive mapping, data visualization, and export – beginner friendly!

## 🌱 Overview

This dashboard helps users visualize and analyze water and soil parameters for any location – no hardware needed. 
Features include:
- Live (simulated) sensor readings for pH, turbidity, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Interactive map with location search, click-to-pinpoint, and popups
- AI-powered crop recommendations based on readings
- Alerts and contextual tips when readings are outside optimal ranges
- Historical log table with export to CSV
- Data chart of pH trend
- FAQ and help section for beginners
- Login/Signup (simulated for demo)

## 🔥 Demo

- Just open `index.html` in any browser!
- Log in or sign up to unlock all features.
- Search for any city, town, or click the map for instant simulated readings.
- Export your data log by clicking the “Export as CSV” button.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sensor Simulation** – See readings update every 2.5s for any location
- **Map Interactivity** – Click on map or search a place to update the marker and dashboard
- **Crop Prediction** – Built-in ML rules recommend best crops for current soil/water
- **History Log** – Table records last readings and lets you export to CSV for analysis
- **Data Visualization** – pH trend chart auto-updates
- **Alerts & Tips** – Visual and contextual feedback if readings are abnormal
- **Beginner Help** – FAQ section for instant guidance

## 🗺️ How To Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-soil-dashboard.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server needed).
3. Login/signup to unlock all features.

## 🧑‍💻 Customization

- Replace simulated sensor logic with real sensor API calls if connecting hardware.
- Expand ML/crop logic (now rule-based) by integrating with backend Python models.
- Add/remove parameters and style as needed.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Vanilla)
- **Leaflet.js** (interactive map)
- **Chart.js** (chart visualization)
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API** (location search)
- (No frameworks required!)

## ❓ FAQ

- **Do I need real sensors?**  
  No! It works with simulated data by default.
- **Can I use real sensor data?**  
  Yes, just connect via API or replace the simulation logic.
- **Is this mobile-friendly?**  
  Yes, works great on phones and tablets!
- **Can I save/share data?**  
  Export as CSV; log is preserved in browser by default.
